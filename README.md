# FastRealBoostBins: An ensemble classifier for fast predictions implemented in Python using numba.jit and numba.cuda

Taking advantage of [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) (a high-performance just-in-time Python compiler) 
we provide a fast operating implementation of a boosting algorithm
in which bins with logit transform values play the role of “weak learners”.

The software comes as a Python class compliant with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) library.
It allows to choose between CPU and GPU computations for each of the two stages: fit and predict (decision function). 
The efficiency of implementation has been confirmed on large data sets where the total of array entries (sample
size $\times$ features count) was of order $10^{10}$ at fit stage and $10^8$ at predict stage.
In case of GPU-based fit, the main boosting loop is designed as five CUDA kernels responsible for: 
weights binning, computing logits, computing exponential errors, finding the error minimizer, and examples reweighting. 
The GPU-based predict is computed by a single CUDA kernel. We apply suitable reduction patterns and mutexes 
to carry out summations and ‘argmin’ operations. 

To test the predict stage performance we compare FastRealBoostBins against state-of-the-art classifiers from sklearn.ensemble 
using large data sets and focusing on response times. In an additional experiment, we make our
classifiers operate as object detectors under heavy computational load (over 60k queries per a video frame using ensembles of size 2048).
